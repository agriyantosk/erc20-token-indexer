# erc20-token-indexer

## Description
This web app is a ERC-20 Token Indexer which will query every ERC-20 token that one wallt has aquired. It currently runs on Ethereum Mainnet and built using NextJS, Rainbowkit, Wagmi, and AlchemySDK. It may still contain a lot of bugs such as mobile display since it was for learning purposes.

## Getting Started

First, clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agriyantosk/erc20-token-indexer.git
npm i
```
Create and fill .env file with ETH Mainnet RPC API key as the .env.sample shows

And then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally go to http://localhost:3000 to see the runing application on development environment.
